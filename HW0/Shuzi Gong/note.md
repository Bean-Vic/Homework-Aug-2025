1. What is the difference between git fetch and git pull?

A **git fetch** updates your local repo with all of the latest changes from a remote repo but doesnâ€™t make any changes to your local workspace.
git fetch downloads remote changes without merging, while git pull fetches and automatically merges them.
If your workspace has no uncommitted files, and you want to copy the latest changes from a remote repository directly into your working directory, then issue the git pull command.
