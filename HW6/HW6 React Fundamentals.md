### 2. Coding

1. Write a `class component`:
    1. Passing in the initial value as props
    2. the component should manage it’s own state.
    3. render current state on web page
    4. build 2 buttons to increase and decrease shown value on previous point
    5. Extra Credit: Write an HOC which will wrap the class component and will `read/write/update` the **initial value** from `localStorage` as cached value. So next time when you open the same application, value will be initialized as last change.
    6. Bonus: Make you App look pretty by using 3rd party CSS components like MUI/tailwindCSS
2. Mini shopping cart
    1. user will be able to choose an item from a `dropdown` component to select the item 
    2. there will be another `input` element allow user to enter quantity of item they select
    3. create a button to allow user add selected item with desired quantity to cart
    4. create a `table` to render purchase summary (item, price, quantity and total)
    5. Extra Credit: allow user delete item from cart
