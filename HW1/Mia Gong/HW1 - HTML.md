1. What is HTML?
HTML is the standard markup language to structure web pages. 
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the most basic building block of the Web. 
It defines the meaning and structure of web content.

2. What is the minimal structure of an HTML5 document?
It starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, then `<html>`, a `<head>` for metadata, and a `<body>` for visible content.  

3. What is the purpose of the meta tag?
Meta tags provide metadata like character encoding, viewport for responsive design, and SEO descriptions.

4. What is the difference between `<head>` and `<header>` ?
- `<head>`: holds metadata, not shown to users.  
- `<header>`: part of the page body, usually a top section with a title or navigation.

5. What is the <form> tag used for in HTML?
It collects user input and sends it to the server, often through GET or POST requests.  

6. Explain the following code
    
    ```html
    <a href="http://example.com/sample_page/" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Link</a>
    ```
This is an anchor tag that contains a URL for redirecting to another page. The rel="noreferrer nofollow" attributes prevent the new opened page from manipulating the original page's JavaScript files and hide information about where the user came from.

7. How do you serve your page in multiple languages?
**Set the lang attribute**

8. What are semantic HTML tags and why are they important?
Tags like <header>, <article>, <section> add meaning.
They improve accessibility, SEO, and code readability.

9. What frontend practices can improve a website’s SEO, and why do they matter?
Use semantic HTML tags → Helps search engines understand content hierarchy
Mobile responsiveness → Google prioritizes mobile-friendly sites
Alt text for images → Improves accessibility and image search indexing
