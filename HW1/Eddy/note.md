# 1. What is HTML?

HTML is a markup language that defines the structure and meaning of content on the web using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images.

# 2. What is the minimal structure of an HTML5 document?

An HTML5 page needs a doctype, an '<html>' tag with a language, a '<head>' with metadata, and a '<body>' with content.

# 3. What is the purpose of the '<meta>' tag?

The '<meta>' tag provides metadata such as character encoding, viewport settings, descriptions, and other hints for browsers and search engines.

# 4. What is the difference between '<head>' and '<header>' ?

'<head>' holds page metadata that is not shown to users, while '<header>' is a visible section inside the document or a section that typically contains a logo, title, or navigation.

# 5. What is the '<form>' tag used for in HTML?

'<form>' defines an area where users can enter and submit data to a server, using controls like inputs, selects, and buttons.

# 6. Explain the following code <a href="http://example.com/sample_page/" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Link</a>

It creates a link to that URL and tells browsers not to send a referrer header and tells search engines not to follow or pass ranking to the target page.

# 7. How do you serve your page in multiple languages?

Provide separate localized pages, set the lang attribute on '<html>', add '<link rel="alternate" hreflang="…">' for each locale, store translations, and offer a clear language switcher; you may detect Accept-Language, but you should not auto-redirect without user choice.

# 8. What are semantic HTML tags and why are they important?

Semantic tags like '<header>', '<nav>', '<main>', '<article>', and '<footer>' describe meaning rather than presentation, which improves accessibility, maintainability, and SEO.

# 9. What frontend practices can improve a website’s SEO, and why do they matter?

Use descriptive titles and meta descriptions, proper headings, semantic HTML, and alt text; ensure fast loading, mobile friendliness, and good Core Web Vitals; add structured data, canonical URLs, clean internal links, and sitemaps, because these help crawlers understand your content and provide a better user experience that search engines reward.
