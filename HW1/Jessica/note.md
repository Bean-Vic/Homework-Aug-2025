1. What is HTML?
HTML is the standard markup language to structure web pages with text, links, images, and other elements.  

2. What is the minimal structure of an HTML5 document?
It starts with `<!DOCTYPE html>`, then `<html>`, a `<head>` for metadata, and a `<body>` for visible content.  

3. What is the purpose of the `<meta>` tag?
It provides metadata like character encoding, viewport for responsive design, and SEO info.  

4. What is the difference between `<head>` and `<header>`?
- `<head>`: holds metadata, not shown to users.  
- `<header>`: part of the page body, usually a top section with a title or navigation.  

5. What is the `<form>` tag used for in HTML?
It collects user input and sends it to the server, often through GET or POST requests.  

6. Explain the following code
```html
<a href="http://example.com/sample_page/" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Link</a>
href: sets the destination.

noreferrer: hides referrer info.

nofollow: tells search engines not to pass ranking credit.

7. How do you serve your page in multiple languages?

Set the lang attribute, create separate translated pages, and use hreflang links for search engines.

Tags like <header>, <article>, <section> add meaning.
They improve accessibility, SEO, and code readability.
